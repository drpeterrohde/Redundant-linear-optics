The manuscript has been updated to add more details about the error model and
introduce it and discuss these issues early in section II.

We already mention this in the discussion.  Furthermore, the encoding need not
be a Fourier transform.  That was just a mathematically convenient construct
for the exposition given in section II.  Fault-tolerance seems possible, but as
this paper was a starting point for just the error detection, this is left as
an open problem.
