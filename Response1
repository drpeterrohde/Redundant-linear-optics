We would like to thank the referee for their careful review of our manuscript.  We have fixed some typographical errors and improved the wording generally in our manuscript.  We have also changed the manuscript in response to the referee's specific issues and we will address them below.

The manuscript has been updated to add more details about the error model and
introduce and discuss these issues early in section II.

This is the example posed early in Section III and introduced briefly in
section II as corollary 1.  We have made changes to the manuscript to emphasise
these as simple examples of the general phenomenon.

These issues are already mentioned in the discussion towards the end of the
paper, however we have now added further comments with respect to this in
Section II. Fault-tolerance under the noise unitary error model seems like it
is possible, but in this paper we have just address the necessary starting
point of error detection.  Fault-tolerance and broader error models is left as
an open problem subsequent to the results presented in this paper.

Furthermore, the encoding operation need not be a Fourier transform.  The
Fourier transform encoding was used as a mathematically convenient construct
for the exposition given in section II.  The is discussed an used in section
III and the alternative encoding with permits nesting is shown in Fig 2.

We trust that our changes address these issues and hope that our modifications will allow for our manuscript to be accepted for publication.
